# ðŸŽ“ Opdracht1 - Console Application: Students and Teachers

This console application was created as a school assignment to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts in C#. The focus is on inheritance, data validation, collections, and user interaction.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

- Defines a base class with shared properties.
- Implements two derived classes:
  - **Student**: includes a year of study.
  - **Teacher**: includes a subject taught (from a fixed list).
- Validates **age** to be between 18 and 99 for both Students and Teachers.
- Provides functions to:
  - Assign names to Students/Teachers via user input.
  - Print the full name of a Student or Teacher.
- Maintains a single **list** containing both Students and Teachers.
- Iterates over the list to print full names and ages.
- Applies proper nullability and uses properties and fields following C# best practices.

## ðŸ›  Key Features

- **Inheritance**: Student and Teacher inherit from a common base class.
- **Input validation**: Ensures age is within specified limits.
- **User input handling**: Assigns names interactively.
- **Collections**: Uses a generic list to store mixed objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Properties for class fields.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the project in your C# development environment.
2. Build and run the console application.
3. Follow prompts to enter names and other details for Students and Teachers.
4. View the printed list of all entries with their full names and ages.

## ðŸ“š Technologies Used

- C# (.NET Console Application)
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Nullable reference types
- Generic Collections (`List<T>`)

## ðŸŽ“ Notes

This project was designed as an exercise to practice inheritance, data validation, and collection management in C#. The code is written entirely in English with attention to null safety and clean design principles.
